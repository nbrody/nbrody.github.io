                    This collection of interactive tools explores the rich connections between algebra, geometry, and arithmetic
                    in the study of linear groups. The project aims to make advanced mathematical concepts accessible through
                    visualization and computation.

                    <h3>What are Linear Groups?</h3>
                    <p>Linear groups are groups of invertible matrices. They appear throughout mathematics, connecting algebra,
                    geometry, number theory, and topology in profound ways.</p>

                    <h3>Three Perspectives</h3>
                    <p>The project is organized around three complementary viewpoints: algebraic structure, geometric actions,
                    and arithmetic properties of linear groups.</p>

                    <p>Each tool provides hands-on exploration of mathematical objects, from visualizing hyperbolic geometry
                    to computing group presentations and exploring quaternion algebras.</p>

                    <h3>Research Context</h3>
                    <p>These tools grew out of research in geometric group theory, particularly the study of lattices in
                    Lie groups and their connections to number theory.</p>
