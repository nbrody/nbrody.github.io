  <h1>Quaternion Groups</h1>
  <p>This is a placeholder page for the Quaternion Groups tool. </p>
    <p>The plan for this tool is to allow the user to specify a finite set of odd primes. Then the tool should output the quaternion primes lying over each of those primes, and all of the relations that determine the cube complex. If the user gives only two primes, the tool should display the full square complex, with each square given a distinct color.</p>
    <p>(1) As a next step, the tool might draw the aperiodic tilings with specified axes. </p>
    <p>(2) The user should be able to enter a finite subset of SO_3(Q), and the tool should output either (i) an axis each of the generators preserves, (ii) a prime p for which the group is p-adically discrete, or (iii) a proof that the group is arithmetic. In case (iii), it should calculate the congruence subgroup as well.</p>
