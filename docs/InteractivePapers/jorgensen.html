      <h2>1. Introduction</h2>
       <!-- Let H denote the 3-dimensional hyperbolic space. It is well known that
H is a Riemannian manifold of constant negative curvature. For any discontinuous 
group G of isometries of H, it is possible to view the coset space
H/G as a manifold of constant negative curvature, allowing for branch
lines or more complicated singularities when G has torsion (i.e., non-trivial
finite subgroups).
In the following, certain special examples of groups and quotient
manifolds will be described for the purpose of justifying:
THEOREM 1. There exist compact 3-manifolds of constant negative
curvature, which fiber over the circle.
In topology it has been rather well understood which compact 3-mani-
folds fiber over the circle since the appearance of Stallings' paper [19].
Other contributions to this subject are presented in [6], [13] and [17]. It is
the negative curvature which is the crucial ingredient of Theorem 1. In
this connection the papers [11], [15] and [16] may be mentioned.
THEOREM 2. There exist torsion-free, discrete, co-compact groups of
hyperbolic isometries which map onto the integers with finitely generated
kernel.
Stallings' theorem makes Theorem 1 an immediate consequence of
Theorem 2. Thus, the problem is to construct a finitely generated group for
which some automorphism merely amounts to conjugation by a transforma-
tion extending the group infinitely to a discontinuous, co-compact group.
We start with a group G generated by two elements X and Y whose
commutator has finite order. The automorphism will be the one determined
by (X, YX) h-+ (XY-1, Y). It is in a sense the simplest among infinitely
many essentially different automorphisms, each of which could have been
used equally well [7]. The chosen limitation makes an elementary and very
explicit treatment possible.
The quotient manifold H/G is homeomorphic to the product of the real
line and a torus with one branch point. For the extended group G*, the
quotient manifold is a twisted product of the circle and a torus with one
branch point.
Instead of the group G, one may start with its extension by the Lie
product of a pair of generators, thereby obtaining a manifold whose fibers
are spheres with four branch points, three of which have order 2.
It is more important to observe that whenever N* is a normal subgroup
of finite index in G*, then the intersection of N* and G is a normal subgroup
of finite index in G, which again admits an infinite cyclic extension. With
use of a lemma of Selberg, this permits us to obtain from the original con-
structions torsion-free groups and hence smooth quotient manifolds as ex-
amples for Theorem 2 and Theorem 1.
The author would like to thank Werner Fenchel, John Milnor and William
Thurston for stimulating interest and helpful criticism without which this
paper would not have been written. Figure 1 was made by Thurston. -->

      <h2>2. The Poincare model</h2>
      <!-- For convenience we identify the hyperbolic space H with the upper
half-space in R3 (bounded br the extended complex plane, C U {oo}). The
points of H may be written in quaternion form h = z + tj, where z is the
orthogonal projection of h onto C and t is the (Euclidean) distance from h
to C. Thus, as a set H-C + R+j. With respect to the hyperbolic metric
ds2-t-2(l dz l2 + dt2), the Euclidean hemispheres (including half-planes) per-
pendicular to C are the planes. Hence, the hyperbolic straight lines are
semicircles perpendicular to C. The isometries of H are complex Mobius
transformations hA(h)-((xh + O(7h + b)-1, where crb-,z = 1 (and the
computation is carried out within the algebra of quaternions). The group
of isometries may be identified with the group of pairs of opposite, complex,
unimodular 2-by-2 matrices, SL(2, C)/{ +id}, discontinuous subgroups of the
former thereby becoming identical with discrete subgroups of the latter. -->

      <h2>3. Isometric hemispheres</h2>
      <!-- With respect to the Euclidean metric Idzl2 + dt2 on H, each Mobius
T dA(h) 1/1 dh I equal to 2 Jh + 8 1-2. If v + O, the locus where the scale ratio is
equal to +1 forms a Euclidean hemisphere lJh + 81-1, with centre-7-18
and radius 1v1-1. This locus is called the tsorBetrtc hersphere of A (in the
complex plane, the circle lJz + 81 = 1 is called the isometric circle of A).

We will be particularly interested in the exterior EA of this isometric hemi-
sphere, defined by the inequality Iyh + al > 1, or in other words jdA(h) j/dhj
By A, it is mapped onto the interior of the isometric hemisphere of A-'. In
terms of hyperbolic geometry, EA is of course a half-space bounded by a
plane.
The virtue of these half-spaces is the following. If G is a discrete group
of Mobius transformations, then intersecting the half-spaces EA, AG G, we
obtain a hyperbolic convex polyhedron which can sometimes be taken as a
fundamental domain for the action of G on H, or from which it is often a
simple matter to obtain such a domain.
Certain general facts about isometric hemispheres follow from the chain
rule for differentiating composite functions. We shall make use of the fol-
lowing two.
If the isometric hemispheres of A and B intersect, then also the isometric
hemispheres of A' and BA-1 and of B-1 and ABR intersect, and the three
edges of intersection are mapped onto each other by A, B and AB-'.
If f is a Euclidean similarity transformation of H, then the isometric 
hemisphere of fAfr' is the image by f of the isometric hemisphere of A. -->

      <h2>4. Lie products</h2>
      <!-- e Mobius transformations (acting on H U C U { o }) which they rep
Suppose that the trace of their commutator is different from 2 (or, what
can be shown to be equivalent, that A and B have no common fixed points
in the extended complex plane). Then, since AB - BA has determinant
equal to 2 - trace ABA-1B-', the Lie product of A and B defines a Mobius
transformation A, which is elliptic of order 2 (its trace being equal to 0). It
is clear that
(AB - BA)A-1 = A(BA-1 - A-1B) and (AB - BA)B-' = B(B-'A - AB-') .
Using the fact that the sum of any two mutually inverse elements of
SL(2, C) is a multiple of the unit element, we obtain
AB-BA = BA-1-A-1B and AB-BA = B-1A-AB-'.
Together, these four identities show that
A-1 = RA'-1 and B-1'
Geometrically, this means that the axis of g is the common perpendicular
to the axis of A and the axis of B, suitably interpreted in case of A or B
being parabolic.
It may be observed that the mapping wA-1B-l is a square root of
ABA-1B-l. In fact, we have 9 = -1 and hence
(wA-lB-1)2-wA-l?9B-lwA-lB-l-ABA-lB-l,
since g transforms A-1 into A and B-1 into B.
